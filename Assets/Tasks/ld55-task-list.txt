----------------------------------
To Do
----------------------------------


balance different summons
bosses
combo system
consider making instant death on priest dying
come up with lots of summon puns and randomize transition

----------------------------------
Complete
----------------------------------
preserve direction on change
enemy target bug
angel projectile: just adjusted animation
new game + level transition text change
music for cybertron level
music for heaven level
add random enemies in cybertron
remove quit button it doesnt work in webgl
summon die swap
add iframes
alt summon swap
alt attack
lower volume on hell track a touch: just made all sounds the same playback level
add resolve for getting pinned with too many enemies: just added support for all direction movement
new game + indicator
can pause during screen transition


----------------------------------
Won't Do?
----------------------------------
hide cursor
add restart to pause menu
attack penalty: penalty is animation time but it'd be nice to give more feedback
